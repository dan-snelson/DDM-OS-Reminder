> A swiftDialog and LaunchDaemon pair for "set-it-and-forget-it" end-user notifications for DDM-required macOS updates

## Overview

While Apple's Declarative Device Management (DDM) provides a powerful way to enforce macOS updates, its built-in notification _tends_ to be too subtle for most Mac Admins:

DDM OS Reminder provides a swiftDialog and LaunchDaemon pair that delivers a more prominent notification to end-users when their Mac needs to be updated to comply with DDM-enforced OS version requirements:

## Features
- **Set-it-and-forget-it**: Once installed, the LaunchDaemon will automatically check the Mac's OS version against the DDM-enforced minimum OS version twice daily and display the swiftDialog notification if an update is required.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the swiftDialog notification's title, message, icon, and button text to fit your organization's needs.
- **Deadline Awareness**: If a DDM-enforced OS version deadline is set, the notification will include a countdown to the deadline, creating a sense of urgency for end-users to update their Macs.
- **Tastefully Intrusive**: The notification is designed to be informative without being overly disruptive, allowing users to continue their work while being reminded of the need to update.
- **Easy Installation**: The script can be easily deployed via MDM solutions, making it simple to roll out across an organization.
- **Logging**: The script logs its actions to a specified log file, allowing administrators to monitor its activity and troubleshoot if necessary.
